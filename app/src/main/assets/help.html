<h4>Custom Name URL (is.gd or v.gd)</h4>
<p>
Custom name is optional. You can specify a custom name if you'd like to pick a shortened URL instead of having is.gd randomly generate one. These must be between 5 and 30 characters long and can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. Shortened URLs are case sensitive. Bear in mind that a desired short URL might already be taken (this is very often the case with common words) so if you're using this option be prepared to respond to an error and get an alternative choice from your app's user. </p>
<p>Example: MYREDCAR
<p>Will generate the short link: https://is.gd/MYREDCAR

<h4>Statistics (is.gd or v.gd)</h4>
<p>Enabling this option turns on logging of detailed statistics when the shortened URL you create is accessed. This allows you to see how many times the link was accessed on a given day, what pages referred people to the link, what browser visitors were using etc.</p>


<h4>Usage limits (is.gd or v.gd)</h4>
